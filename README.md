<h3 align="left">Description:</h3>
<p align="left">This project aims to examine a discrete-time dynamical system that models the population dynamics of three interacting species x, y and z, with non-overlapping generations, analyzing the conditions that lead to species extinction and those that result in stabilization on periodic orbits, using advanced mathematical
techniques. This involves studying the stability of equilibrium points, or the existence and stability of periodic solutions. We also use numerical methods to simulate the dynamics of the system and study its behaviour under different initial conditions and parameter values, providing a deeper understanding of complex ecological interactions between multiple species. </p>
