<h3 align="left">Description:</h3>
<p align="left">This project aims to explore the incidence of larynx cancer in the districts of Mersey and West Lancashire in the north-east of England using data collected over a 10-year period (1982-1991). The data is analyzed using a combination of exploratory data analysis, Poisson distribution, Bayesian inference, and spatial correlation techniques to better understand the incidence of larynx cancer in this region. The project includes the analysis of Standardized Mobility Ratio (SMR) and the estimation of relative risk for each electoral district. The results of this study are presented in the form of plots and discussion, highlighting key findings and observations about the incidence of larynx cancer in the north-east of England </p>
